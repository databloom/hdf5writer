# hdf5writer

This is a collection of scripts and screen sessions collecting ad-hoc tests for measuring how different python libraries perform with different filesystems, some local, some over NAS for generating .h5 files under centos. 

The intention is to provide a starting point for objective performance evaluation, a ruler to define the sides of a performance envolope for commiting data to an .h5 file for varying workloads.
